### Introduction
In APCSA (AP Computer Science A) we are curretly learning about Array List in Java. This unit has so far been challenging but after some background knowldege about arrays in Java unit 6 it was easy to understand but I didn't do to well in the unit 7 exam. Throughout this writeup I will take you through some of my challenges, thinkings, and questions I got wrong on the exam.
